# 05_Third_Party_Api_Challenge

## Description

This is a challenge to accept user input, save them to localStorage and then display them as color-coded cards according to their due date: red for overdue, orange for today, and white for incoming due date. Data is persistent since the input is stored in localStorage as an array of Objects.

## Objective

-To be able to render each task in a color coded manner to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red)
-To be able to let users enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog
-To be able to save the inputs into localStorage upon submission
-To be able to drag tasks into differnent columns and have the task's progress state be updated accordingly and be persistent in the new column after refreshing
-To be able to delete tasks

## Usage

Simply press "Add Task", fill out the forms and click submit. The To-Do section will display your initial input with the appropriate color.
Drag to the "In Progress" or "Done" section whichever is more appropriate and the card will stick to it. This gives a user the ability to organize tasks and to keep tabs on the due dates as the color is a good indication of deadlines.
